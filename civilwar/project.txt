Years of fighting, the emancipation of millions of slaves, and the reconstruction of a fractured nation forced the question of African American citizenship and political rights to the forefront. Reconstruction raised critical questions, largely dormant since the writing of the Constitution, about the role of the federal government in determining the breadth of the franchise. At this crucial juncture in American history, the issue of black enfranchisement was thrust onto the national agenda.   Before the Civil War broke out, only five states—all in New England—permitted blacks to vote on the same basis as whites, and New York enfranchised African Americans who met a property requirement. The Civil War brought new impetus for states to work to abolish racial discrimination from their laws. The four million former slaves had claims to civil and political rights. Almost 200,000 African Americans from the North and South alike had fought and died for their freedom and to preserve the Union, and could now make the claim that Americans had been making for years—that those who bore arms should be granted the right to vote. Even those who had not fought felt that voting was their right as free people.

Led by ministers, veterans, and established free blacks, they wrote petitions, held meetings, and paraded through the streets, demanding to be granted the right to vote. To African Americans, enfranchisement not only constituted a means of self-protection, but was a critical symbol and expression of their standing in American society. In Wilmington, North Carolina, freedmen organized an Equal Rights League demanding that blacks be granted “all the social and political rights” that whites possessed. In 1865, the highly politicized black community of New Orleans staged a mock election to demonstrate the strength of their resolve.  African Americans advocating for their own enfranchisement enjoyed the support of many Northern whites. Certain elements of the Republican party—which controlled Congress during Reconstruction—embraced the idea of “impartial” or “universal” suffrage, and leading sympathetic whites offered forceful and eloquent pleas for the cause of black suffrage in speeches and in the newspapers. Influential Protestant minister Henry Ward Beecher was one of the most outspoken advocates: “The broad and radical democratic doctrine of the natural rights of men,” Beecher declared, “shall be applied to all men, without regard to race, or color, or condition.” Suffrage “is not a privilege or a prerogative, but a right. Every man has a right to have a voice in the laws, the magistracies, and the politics that take care of him.

The idea that African Americans might vote on equal footing with white citizens ran contrary to the deep-seated racism and the legal codes that had worked for almost 200 years to relegate and segregate blacks to a position of inferiority.  But opposition to African American suffrage was not confined to the South. Racism persisted in the North, and emancipation only exacerbated fears of mass migration of freedmen away from the South. Efforts to enfranchise African Americans in northern states failed repeatedly following the Civil War: between 1863 and 1870, proposals to enfranchise blacks were defeated in more than fifteen northern states. Although most northern Republicans supported black suffrage, Democrats adamantly opposed it, and they generally were joined by enough Republicans to guarantee popular or legislative defeat of reforms.

Johnson’s proposals effectively would have guaranteed that the political status quo would remain unchanged.  The Republican-controlled Congress refused to accept this approach, and formulated its own version of Reconstruction beginning in 1866, imposing far harsher penalties on the leaders of the rebellion, and requiring far more of each state being re-admitted to the Union. Although relatively few Republicans at that juncture advocated black enfranchisement, they did seek to guarantee the civil rights of blacks and promote greater racial equality in southern society.

It had become apparent that the sanctions built in to the 14th Amendment would not be sufficient to protect African American suffrage. Support for the Republican party, particularly its more radical elements was declining, and by the next election cycle, the remaining southern states would be readmitted to the Union. It was also clear, given the repeated defeats of black enfranchisement in northern states, that the states could not be counted on to ensure African American suffrage themselves. Accordingly the Republicans in Congress announced shortly after the election of 1868 that they would press forward with a constitutional amendment to enfranchise African Americans. With control of the federal government slipping through the fingers of Republicans and southern opposition to black equality intensifying, something had to be done by the federal government soon to guarantee African American suffrage more permanently.   A constitutional amendment would be a permanent grant of political rights to African Americans in the South and the North alike. Stronger than an act of Congress, it could not be challenged in the Supreme Court, and would be more efficient than changes to individual state constitutions.

Congress took up the question in January and February 1869, and debate raged in both houses—a dramatic and extraordinary discussion that was the first time that the federal government had ever taken up the issue of voting rights directly. Congressmen filled both chambers with impassioned speeches that showed their deeply held convictions. They offered carefully nuanced historical and theoretical arguments, and engaged in prolonged parliamentary maneuvering. The debate began with a strategic focus on the rights of African Americans, particularly in the South, but it soon broadened into a far-reaching consideration of the meaning of democracy and the power of the national government.   A much more detailed account of the debates could be told here, but the short version goes like this: two versions of the 15th Amendment were proposed. One was the 15th Amendment as we know it today—a narrow prohibition against passing laws that denied the right to vote on account of race or previous condition of servitude. The other version, which came very close to passing, was a far broader guarantee of suffrage—one that touched on race, religion, ethnicity, and a variety of other factors.

Its language was simple: “the right of any citizen of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of race, color, or previous condition of slavery of any citizens or class of citizens of the United States.”  Democrats and a few conservative Republicans felt that Boutwell’s amendment infringed upon state sovereignty. Radical Republicans, on the other hand, thought Boutwell’s version was too weak, and that they could secure the passage of a far more expansive amendment.

It is important to note that both versions of the amendment proposed in the House were phrased negatively—rather than being active conferrals of the right to vote, they simply prevented states from restricting the franchise along certain lines.

Wilson’s amendment prohibited discrimination “among the citizens of the United States in the exercise of the elective franchise, or in the right to hold office in any State, on account of race, color, nativity, property, education or creed.” Wilson’s version would have permitted qualifications based on age and residence, saving it from some criticism leveled at the broad version in the House.  Wilson and his allies made several strong arguments in favor of a broadly phrased amendment. First and foremost, they predicted (correctly) that a narrow amendment that only prohibited discrimination based on race would be easy to circumvent, and that southern states could disfranchise blacks using mechanisms that were not overtly racial like literacy, tax, or property requirements. Wilson also believed that because it would enfrachise almost all adult males—including immigrants who would support the Democrats in the North—that it stood a good chance of being ratified. Finally, Wilson argued that a universal guarantee of suffrage was the right thing to do—that if African Americans deserved the right to vote, then so did all other men.

Several senators opposed on the grounds that it would produce a “radical and revolutionary” transformation of the relationship between the federal government and the states with regard to the franchise. As Senator James Dixon of Connecticut pointed out, at issue was not simply who voted but “who shall create . . . the voter.” The Wilson amendment would vest that power in the federal government and in so doing, alter the Constitution while undermining the autonomy and authority of the states.

Many northeastern states, including Rhode Island, had similar feelings regarding the Irish. The amendment passed easily only in New England, where blacks already voted, and in the South, where the federal government had compelled black enfranchisement. Ratification of the amendment was also made a condition for readmission for the four southern states that remained outside of the Union.   The debate over ratification was partisan nearly everywhere. Democrats argued that the amendment violated state sovereignty and that it threatened democratic values by enfranchising inferior people. The Republicans insisted that African Americans—by virtue of their service during the war and their citizenship, deserved the right to vote.

Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts introduced the Federal Elections Bill. It became known as the “Force Bill,” because it would have forced districts in the South to have their electoral procedures approved and supervised by the federal government.   The Lodge Force Bill came quite close to passing Congress, but ultimately failed to receive the necessary support, bringing congressional efforts to enforce the 15th Amendment to a halt. Once again, by a small margin, the federal government backed away from a significant expansion of its role in shaping electoral law and guaranteeing democratic rights. Congress’s decision in January 1891 signaled to the South that the federal government was not prepared to actively protect the voting rights of blacks.   Several years later, when Democrats again gained control of both Congress and the presidency, they further distanced the federal government from its involvement in protecting voting rights by repealing the Enforcement Acts of the 1870s. Whatever the 14th and 15th Amendments said on paper, the right to vote had always rested in the hands of the states, and would continue to reside there. Not until the 1960s, when the Lodge Force Bill was reincarnated as Lyndon Johnson's Voting Rights Act, did Congress again seriously consider federal intervention in southern politics.

In just a few years, white southerners successfully rolled back all of the progress that had been made toward African American suffrage in the South, removing an entire population from the franchise less than a quarter-century after they had been granted it.   The 1890s launched a period when many state constitutions were rewritten in the South, as white political leaders sought to replace the documents drafted during Reconstruction. In them, states adopted poll taxes, cumulative poll taxes (demanding that past as well as current taxes be paid), literacy tests, secret ballot laws, lengthy residence requirements, elaborate registration systems, confusing multiple voting box arrangements, and criminal exclusion laws, all aimed at disenfranchising African Americans en masse.

Election officials could administer tests, file paperwork, grant exceptions, or issue tax receipts according to their preference, clearing the way easily for white voters, but erecting every manner of obstacle for potential black voters, ensuring they never came close to the polls.  “Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what we propose,” intoned future Senator Carter Glass at Virginia's Constitutional Convention of 1901–1902. “That, exactly, is what this convention was elected for—to discriminate to the very extremity of permissible action under the limitations of the Federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every Negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate.”   To ensure that voting laws were as efficient as possible in discriminating against African Americans, states adopted grandfather clauses that exempted men from literacy, tax, residency, or property requirements if they performed military service or if their ancestors voted in the 1860s. The first southern grandfather clause was adopted in South Carolina in 1890, and most other southern states followed suit soon thereafter.

That they were poor, often illiterate, and did not speak English made matters far worse.  Furthermore, the disadvantaged position of immigrants made them more likely to support political machines, or “boss rule,” which threatened to legitimize their political power and undermine traditional political systems. Machine politics operated in a very transactional way—promising favors and benefits in exchange for loyalty and votes. The notoriously corrupt Tweed Ring in New York and other machines in cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco flourished with immigrant support, and appeared to threaten core American values to those who opposed them.  Finally, many felt that the very poor constituted a threat to property. “There is probably no sweeter experience in the world than that of a penniless laborer . . . when he learns that by casting his vote in the right way he can strip the rich merchant or ship-owner of a portion of his gains,” wrote nationalist historian Francis Parkman.

Many of these rules were purely administrative, but as conflict over the political rights of immigrants intensified, many laws were aimed at purifying the electorate in the North, just as they had been in the South.  Among the laws enacted in northern states to influence the outcome of elections were laws that affected the weight, or value, of votes cast. Legislative gerrymandering of electoral districts could help ensure that the number of seats that immigrant voters—who were often confined to distinct poor neighborhoods—could control was kept at a minimum. Many states also passed laws governing how candidates could appear on the ballot, in an attempt to combat the negative effects of machine politics.

Laws set out the fundamental qualifications that a man (or woman) had to meet in order to become an eligible voter, and increasingly worked to establish the procedures that a potential voter had to follow in order to participate in elections. Both types remained under state control, since the Constitution and federal courts continued to say little about suffrage, except with regard to race. In every state, changes in both substantive and procedural laws were proposed and debated, often giving rise to reforms that effectually narrowed the franchise.  Justified as measures to limit corruption or to produce a more competent electorate, such efforts included the introduction of literacy tests, lengthening residency requirements, abolishing provisions that permitted non-citizen aliens to vote, and the creation of complex, cumbersome registration procedures. Stripping voters of the franchise was a politically delicate operation that generally had to be performed obliquely and without provoking considerable backlash. It should be noted that the effort to keep immigrants from the polls was distinct from the movement to restrict immigration itself—and the laws aimed at keeping immigrants from the polls were in force long before Congress passed the path-breaking Restriction and Quota Acts of 1921 and 1924.

As the pace of westward migration quickened, population mobility increased, and itinerant labor became more common, it became increasingly difficult to define what exactly it meant to be a resident of a particular place. States and localities worked to define rules and regulations to determine what constituted a resident for the purposes of voting.  The shape these rules took was often the subject of conflict, but disputes related to residency were largely left up to the courts to resolve. Citizens challenged their exclusion from the polls under residency laws. These cases were made more complicated by the accepted legal notion that a person’s physical presence in a community for a specified length of time was not sufficient by itself for a person to be considered a resident. As the Supreme Court of Colorado put it in 1896:   we think the residence . . . contemplated [by the constitution] is synonymous with “home” or “domicile,” and means actual settlement within the state, and its adoption as a fixed and permanent habitation; and requires not only a personal presence for this requisite time, but a concurrence there with an intention to make the place of inhabitancy the true home.

Absentee voting was rare in the 19th century, particularly before the Civil War. But the desire to permit soldiers to vote drove more states to provide for absentee voting.  World War I added a new urgency to the issue, as more than 3,000,000 men were deployed away from their homes for military service. Accordingly, by 1918, nearly all states had made provisions for absentee voting for soldiers away from home.  The functional mechanism for absentee voting for soldiers opened the door for wider dispensation of the rest of the population, and by the end of World War I more than 20 states had provided for absentee voting on the part of anyone who could demonstrate a work-related reason—and in some cases, any reason—for being absent on election day.

Before the 1870s, most states prepared a list of eligible voters, and beyond that no one was obliged to take any steps to establish their eligibility prior to election day. Voters might be required to bring naturalization papers, for instance, but all of that occurred at the polls themselves.  Between the 1870s and World War I, however, the majority of states adopted formal registration procedures. The rationale for such regulations was straightforward: to eliminate fraud and to facilitate answering questions of eligibility, which could become disruptive when answered at the polls. It would greatly facilitate the process of checking papers, interrogating witnesses, and verifying the qualifications of those who wished to vote.  The idea of pre-registration was more or less universally accepted. But as with any question, the requirements and implementation of registration procedures were hotly contested. Requirements varied widely from state to state, as did their impact once they were implemented, which depended not only on the details of the laws themselves but also on the ability and determination of political parties to get their own voters registered. In New Jersey, for example, the passage of new registration laws in the early 20th century was immediately followed by a sharp decline in turnout. In other states, however, the impact was negligible.

Often disenfranchisement was for “infamous” crimes—crimes that in common law prohibited their perpetrator from testifying in court. Of course, in the South, these measures often included lesser offenses that targeted African Americans.  In most states, though, these laws were passed without much discussion. There was great variation in the duration of the exclusion. In almost all states, felons were disfranchised only while they remained in prison, but in many, the disfranchisement was understood to be permanent, although it was possible in some places for ex-felons to have their voting rights restored, usually by the governor. These laws were almost never objected to, and they were consistently upheld in the courts, which ruled that the states had both the right to disfranchise felons and a compelling interest in doing so.

Long the targets of resettlement programs that destroyed the way of life and stability, by 1900 there were less than 250,000 Native Americans in recognized tribes. The 14th Amendment had an interesting effect on Native Americans. Some interpreted the language: “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States” to mean that all Native Americans were now citizens, but the interpretation was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1870, which ruled that those associated with recognized tribes were not born under the jurisdiction of the United States and thus were not citizens.  It was formal policy, however, to encourage Indian citizenship and Indian assimilation into American society. In 1887 Congress passed the General Allotment (or Dawes) Act, which granted citizenship to all Native Americans who “adopted the habits of civilized life,” as well as those who accepted private allotments of what had been tribal lands. Under the Dawes Act, more than half of all Native Americans had become citizens by 1905. Even more became citizens when those who served in World War I were granted citizenship, and in 1924, Congress finally declared that all Indians born in the United States were citizens.  The prevailing policy was clear if difficult to apply: Native Americans could become voters, but only by surrendering or repudiating their own culture, economic organization, and society norms.

During Reconstruction, the federal government had asserted its jurisdiction in unprecedented ways with the passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments. And for several decades following the war, the federal government exercised some authority to protect the suffrage rights of citizens across the country. African Americans voted in large numbers across the South, and racial bars to the polls lifted in the North as well.  But this tilt towards nationalization of the right to vote proved to be both short-lived and fragmentary. The decision of  Congress to adopt a narrow version of the 15th Amendment, rather than the one that protected a broad-based right to vote, as well as the failure to pass the Lodge Force Bill effectively removed the federal government from most questions of suffrage by the end of the 19th century, paving the way for states to define the contours of their own franchise in almost any way they saw fit.

The parallels between North and South, of course, ought not to be overdrawn. What transpired in the southern states was far more draconian, sweeping, and violent. The disfranchisement was massive rather than segmented, the laws were enforced brutally, and they were always administered with overtly discriminatory intent. In New York and Massachusetts, an illiterate immigrant could get the franchise by learning to read; for a black man in Alabama, education was beside the point, whatever the law said. What transpired in the North was far milder than the parallel movement in the South—a testimony not only to the significance of race but also to differences in the regions’ social structures and political organizations.  In both the North and South, the legal contraction of the franchise following Reconstruction made a significant difference. Millions of people—most of them working class and poor—were deprived of the right to vote in municipal, state, and national elections. Their exclusion from the electorate meant that the outcomes of political contests were altered, different policies were put into place, different judges appointed, different taxes imposed, and the relative strength of the two major parties, at least in some cities and states, was reversed, not momentarily, but for decades.

These laws had been put in place to encourage settlement in sparsely populated areas, but as immigrants became less likely to be permanent settlers in a given location, and much more likely to be itinerant works or flock to urban areas, these laws were quickly stricken from the books.  New obstacles were placed in the path of immigrant voters as well. Many states moved to require naturalized citizens to present their naturalization papers to election officials before registering or voting. Lawmakers knew this requirement would pose a significant procedural hurdle for many immigrants, who might not have their papers or be unaware of this requirement.  Another method, reminiscent of Know-Nothing proposals, was to prohibit naturalized citizens from voting unless they had been nationalized for a specified (and often lengthy) period of time before an election. These laws placed an additional burden on foreign-born citizens and prevented aliens from voting if they were naturalized too soon before an election.

It was an attractive idea to many that voters should be required to be literate in the English language. Reading and writing could help voters make more informed choices, while simultaneously keeping large portions of the immigrant population from voting. Education or literacy requirements were more popular than taxpaying requirements or other economic bars to voting, and they were not overtly discriminatory—like waiting periods after naturalization.

As a result of this opposition, which came mostly from the Democrats who were supported by immigrants in large part, many states outside of the South ultimately did not adopt literacy tests. Missouri rejected a literacy test in 1875, as did Michigan in 1907, and Illinois voted against one on several occasions, up to and including 1920. In New Mexico, the sizable Spanish-speaking electorate went so far as to write into the state’s first constitution that “the right of any citizen . . . to vote . . . shall never be restricted, abridged, or impaired on account of inability to speak, read, or write the English and Spanish languages.” Immigrants in New York, backed by the Irish and later the Italian and Jewish communities, successfully resisted a test until after World War I.  Nonetheless, by the mid-1920s, 13 states in the North and West had literacy tests in force, disfranchising voters who met all the other eligibility requirements. They were effective in disenfranchising significant portions of the population, even in the early part of the 20th century. The 1920 census reported the 8% of the voting-age population was illiterate, and 25% of men who took an army literacy test during World War I were judged to be illiterate. It is difficult to say how many voters were disenfranchised because of literacy tests, but a reasonable estimate is that a minimum of 700,000 voters—likely more than 1 million—were barred by these tests.
