The debates about suffrage in the Philadelphia Convention were brief, and the final document did very little to define the breadth of the franchise. Only Article I, Section 2 mentions voting directly:  The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.  The Virginia Plan had proposed that the members of the Lower House would be elected by “the people of the several states,” but did not specify any qualification for the actual voting.

Some of the delegates did not immediately embrace this deference to the states’ individual judgment. When the Convention debated the provision on August 7, some thought it improper to grant this power to the states, and others wished to see even more robust property qualifications than this provision would guarantee. James Wilson defended the choice: “This part of the report was well considered by the committee, and he did not think it could be changed for the better. It was difficult to form any uniform rule of qualifications for all the states.” He and others pointed out that the Framers would be inciting unnecessary enemies to the Constitution if people who could vote in local and state elections were disfranchised from voting in the national elections. The upshot was that it would have been too difficult, even at this early juncture in American history, to find a universal rule that every state would have found acceptable.

Choosing the president by popular election, though it had a small group of adherents including James Wilson, never received serious consideration from the delegates.  Finally, the Constitution offers the vague provision that “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government,” which seems to provide at least some assurance that a right to vote would be protected, again at the level of each state. Aside from these three provisions the Constitution was mute on the right to vote, but the document would form the foundation for the struggle to define the franchise in all that would follow.

Voting in England had long been restricted to adult men who owned property, and that tradition had extended naturally to the American colonies.  At this time, property qualifications for suffrage were quite common, and all states had instituted some kind of property qualification. Some of the requirements were relatively small, and perhaps only required that a voter pay some sort of tax in the previous year. But on the eve of the Revolution, in seven colonies men had to own land of certain amount of acreage or monetary value in order to participate in elections; elsewhere, the ownership of other personal property of a designated value (or in South Carolina, the payment of taxes) could substitute for real estate. Click on the buttons, left, to explore the two primary grounds for property requirements on voting.  Henry Ireton, a leader of the English Civil War wrote in 1647 “if there be anything at all that is the foundation of liberty, it is this, that those who shall choose the lawmakers shall be men freed from dependence upon others.”  Six of the thirteen colonies voted viva voce—by voice—usually at an appointed time at the local courthouse, so it was reasonable to assume that a debtor or a tenant could feel pressure to vote a certain way in the presence of their creditor or landlord. It was not until much later that the secret paper ballot became widely used. Several colonies formally barred servants and paupers from voting for the same reasons.

For the same reason property was seen as giving someone a stake in society, so too did residency contribute to their investiture in the colony’s affairs and to their knowledge of issues and candidates. At the same time, however, absentee landowners were enfranchised in Virginia in 1736.  In some places, further limitations were put in place because of social factors like race or religion. Free blacks were legally disenfranchised very early on in much of the south, and Native Americans were likewise denied the right to vote. In 17th-century Massachusetts, only members of the Congregational Church could vote; in Virginia only members of the Church of England could vote for a time; and in the 18th century, Catholics were disfranchised in five states and Jews in four states.  Women were kept from the polls in many places for a combination of the reasons explained above. Because they were supposed to follow the will of their husbands, they could not practice independent decision-making of their own. Women in most cases could not own property, and so lacked the required stake in their community, and finally, their “constitution” was supposedly too delicate to equip them to participate in the serious affairs of politics. Women were barred from voting explicitly by law in several colonies, including Virginia, but statutes elsewhere made no reference to gender, and in at least a few Massachusetts towns and New York counties propertied windows did legally vote.

Voting, after all, is the key mechanism for people to participate in the formation of their government.

On the other hand, a larger portion of the population, which included small yeoman farmers, laborers, craftsmen, and others stood to gain dramatically from a democratization of political rights.

The constitution produced by that convention was easily the most democratic constitution in the thirteen original states: it abolished property requirements and enfranchised all taxpaying adult males as well as the sons of freeholders regardless of whether or not they were taxpayers. Pennsylvania had a poll tax—which had not yet acquired the discriminatory connotation it would come to hold during the Jim Crow era, but rather was merely an evenly applied tax on every head of household—that effectively enfranchised the vast majority of adult males under the new constitution. The new Pennsylvania constitution had shifted the definition of the population regarded as having a “sufficient common interest with and attachment to the community.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_826","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_826","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_827","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_827","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide73760","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Pennsylvania's unique constitution","thumbnail":"dr/Slide73760_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si73794","Text_Caption_1261","Text_Caption_1262","Text_Caption_1263"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide73760"}}},{"id":"si73942","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si73991","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_379","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_379","title":"The Road to Partial Democracy ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1146","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1146","roles":{}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_242","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_242","title":"The American Revolution and the Right to Vote ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1264","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1264","title":"Revolution and a Broader Franchise in Some States ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1265","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1265","title":"The political dynamics of revolution generated a broader franchise in a half dozen other states as well—Maryland, New Jersey, Georgia, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, and Vermont all broadened their franchise in the 1770s and 1780s.

First, suffrage was defined as a constitutional issue: all of the early state constitutions except for Delaware treated the right to vote as a matter of fundamental, constitutional law, rather than normal statute law. Implicit here was an understanding that voting requirements should be durable and difficult to change; in an era of great legislative power, state lawmaking bodies were notably not entrusted with the power to tamper with the right to vote.

The House of Representatives was the only federal office for which the Constitution required popular election.  The decision of the Constitutional Convention was largely practical. They had left the difficult question of voting qualifications up to the Committee of Detail, which met in late July and early August. That committee recommended something close to the final language, which passed on the opportunity to create a national voting rule.  There was a great fear that instituting a national suffrage requirement would jeopardize the ratification of the proposed constitution. To begin with, it would have been nearly impossible to find a rule that did not greatly contradict the existing standard in at least a few states. And so any national suffrage requirement was likely to generate opposition in one state or another. Additionally, a narrow national voting requirement could have inspired such popular opposition to the Constitution that it would have doomed its chances of ratification altogether.

By the 1850s, however, even taxpaying requirements were falling out of use—between 1830 and 1855, six states relinquished their insistence that voters pay taxes, leaving only six others with taxpaying clauses.  The franchise was also expanded to resident aliens in many states during the first part of the 19th century—but their voting status continues to fluctuate and evolve even today. In 1800, some state constitutions specified that voters had to be citizens, while others conferred the franchise on the more vague and inclusive “inhabitants.” The federal government, hoping to encourage settlement, expressly permitted resident aliens to vote in the Northwest Territories. Thus in many locales, foreign-born men who had not be naturalized by the federal government but who did meet property, taxpaying, and residency requirements were able to participate in elections.

The formation of broadly based political parties that competed systematically for votes.  Every state that had a property requirement in force in 1790 experienced a substantial increase in the number of its adult white male residents who did not meet the requisite level of property ownership. Urban populations were growing, and even financially stable city-dwellers could not own any real property. Mechanics, laborers, artisans, managers, shopkeepers, and other groups of urban residents found themselves disqualified to vote for economic reasons. Even some farmers in rural areas were disqualified because they leased the land they worked rather than owning it themselves.  These changes in the social structure created significant and growing clusters of men who were full participants in economic and social life but who lacked political rights.

In the wake of the Revolutionary War and again after the War of 1812, many middle class citizens concluded that extending the franchise to the “lower orders” would enhance their own security and help preserve their way of life, by assuring that such men would continue to serve in the army and the militias, and would not be given to unrest or hostility to the new government.

By guaranteeing the political rights of poor whites, the social elites hoped they could count on the support of all whites in the event of a slave rebellion.  In the Midwest, the promotion of settlement and economic self-interest played a major role in expanding the franchise. As the western territories began to organize themselves into states, inhabitants of sparsely populated regions established a broader franchise in an effort to attract more settlers. As more people flowed into a particular region, land values increased and the pace of economic development quickened. Competition among states on the frontier only served to further broaden the franchise. Granting full political rights to immigrants appeared to be econonomically advantageous as well as democratic, a testament to the desirability of the franchise.

The Federalist party had pretty much faded from existence by the end of the 1820s, and it was quickly replaced by the Whig party, which aligned itself against the Democrats in a series of hyper-competitive elections beginning in the 1830s. Less than 50 years after the Constitution was ratified there was a strong and vibrant national party system. Elections were systematically contested, and party loyalty and identification became prominent elements of public life. Unsurprisingly, in this competitive political culture, the issue of suffrage inescapably attached itself to partisan rivalries.  To some degree the involvement of political parties in debates over suffrage was a straightforward reflection of their ideological differences. The Federalists, who relied on the strength of northeastern elites and established political power tended to oppose any broadening of the franchise, whereas the more egalitarian Jeffersonian Republicans viewed expansion more favorably.

The Whigs, on the other hand, clung to a more hierarchical vision for society, believing in a more active state, the affairs of which were best conducted by society’s “natural” leaders. As a result, the Whigs were included to resist efforts to enlarge the franchise.  But this was politics—and ideological leanings and theoretical constructions of political society could not alone determine what would transpire. Self-interested political parties were keenly aware of both the advantages and potential disadvantages of enfranchising new voters—who were potential supporters. The outcomes of elections could easily depend on the size and the shape of the electorate, and so it was natural that parties might try to broaden the franchise in an effort to win elections, whatever their ideological views about democratization. In the 1830s, the Democratic party established itself as the nation’s first mass-based political organization, and popular elections spread widely. The nature of partisan competition was such that if any party or faction—out of conviction or political self-interest—actively promoted a broader franchise, it put pressure on their adversaries to join in, lest it risk alienating large groups of people who might soon be granted the right to vote.

Proponents of expanding the franchise rejected the conservative view that voting was a privilege that the state could limit however it wished to further its own interests, instead taking the position that voting was a right, but a right that had to be earned: by paying taxes, serving in the militia, or even laboring on the public roads. The notion of an earned right made clear that the goal of most suffrage reformers was not a universal right to vote but rather an enfranchisement of what New Yorker Samuel Young described as an “intermediate class.”  This shift was manifested at the numerous state constitutional conventions that took place during this time period. Nathan Sanford, a noted proponent of expanding suffrage in New York argued: “Those who bear the burdens of the state should choose those that rule it.” That simple proposition meshed well with the rhetoric of the Revolution, appealing to demands that all taxpayers vote and that it was injustice to withhold the franchise from those who fought for the nation and served in its militias.
