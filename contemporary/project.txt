Named for one of its earliest practitioners, Elbridge Gerry, districts have held unequal weight or skewed representative power dating back to the famous \"rotten boroughs\" in the English Parliament.   If the issue seems more controversial to us today, that is probably because the tools available to politicians who want to draw district lines in their own favor are now more sophisticated than ever before. Massive amounts of demographic data allow computer models to produce near-certain results with small margins. Gerrymanding efforts have been so successful in some places that representatives are now seemingly choosing their voters instead of voters choosing their representatives.   Legislatures have succeeded in creating many “safe” districts, where the election of one party or the other is almost a foregone conclusion. This in turn has resulted in more intense political partisanship, as candidates contest primary elections rather then general elections, polarizing the partisan divide even further. These effects of gerrymandering have spawned widespread cynicism among the electorate, as voters have come to believe that their votes do not matter and that the partisan political discourse has become poisonous.

The issue has entered the courts as well: in March 2015, the Supreme Court asked Alabama to take a second look at the districts its legislators drew in 2012 following accusations of racial gerrymandering. The Court has recently agreed to take up Evenwel v. Abbott, a case that questions whether districts must be drawn so that they contain an equal distribution of citizens who are eligible to vote (rather than simply “persons”). If the Court sides with the plaintiffs in this case, then districts with a high proportion of non-citizen immigrants, children, or prisoners would have to be significantly redrawn—depriving these areas of a large share of their current political clout.  Like the Court’s “one-person, one-vote” mandate, it would cause enormous upheavals in existing district lines.

On Election Night, no clear winner had emerged, and by the next morning it was clear that the two candidates were mired in a political deadlock that would call into question individual votes as well as the value of those votes.  Gore was leading Bush by more than 200,000 votes in the national popular vote. In the electoral votes, Gore sat at 267, while Bush had collected 246.

Florida law required an automatic recount because of the narrow margin, the results of which reduced Bush’s lead in Florida to just a few hundred votes. The recount didn’t come close to settling the issue; in fact, it complicated things even further. Questions swirled about the way ballots were filled out, the legitimacy of a large number of absentee ballots, and precincts with wildly disproportionate numbers of votes cast for lower offices, but not for president, suggesting technological errors. The watchword became whether a “hanging chad” could count as a vote or if a ballot card had to be punched all the way through.   Because of the uncertainty of many of the ballots cast in Florida, the election was essentially a tie—the margin of victory was smaller than the margin of error that could be achieved in counting the votes.

Commentators questioned Florida’s state and local voting laws—focusing a fine beam of light on which portions of the Florida population were denied the right to vote, and how those restrictions stacked up against the laws of other states. A new dimension was injected into the conversation of the meaning of the right to vote, which was in some ways an extension of vote dilution. Questions were swirling not only about the meaning of the right to vote, but the right to have one’s vote counted accurately. During the election of 2000, new technology had cast into doubt whether voters could expect their votes to be counted accurately.   Ultimately, the Supreme Court settled the controversy in Bush v. Gore. The decision halted the hand recount that the Gore campaign had requested and the Florida Supreme Court had granted, which had the effect of delivering Florida’s electoral votes—and the election—to George W. Bush. Implicit in the holding was a reading of Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which governs the choosing of a state’s presidential electors. The opinion in Bush v. Gore ruled that even if a state awarded the choosing of electors to the people, it would reassign that responsibility at any time, even after an election had been held. Under the ruling in Bush v. Gore, then, the Florida legislature could assign electors however it saw fit. The opinion generated a remarkable amount of controversy, and in some obvious ways calls into question the durability of Americans’ right to vote in presidential elections.

The circumstances under which it was renewed was both a testament to central place the Voting Rights Act had come to play protecting minority voting rights, and the very structure of voting law in the United States.    Nonetheless, a week after President George W. Bush signed the reauthorized Voting Rights Act, it was challenged. The lawsuit, which worked its way through the courts over the course of two years, eventually came to be known as Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder. The appellant argued that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority by extending Section 5’s preclearance requirement. At the core of the argument was the idea that racial discrimination was no longer the crucial problem that it had been in 1965, and that Section 5 imposed an unfair and unnecessary burden on covered jurisdictions, in effect punishing them for past transgressions.

In fact, several of the more conservative justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, had expressed reservations about the Voting Rights Act, and even some liberal justices had concerns about particular aspects of the 2006 reauthorization.

The justices in the majority felt that under the circumstances, Section 4 constituted a violation of the principles of federalism and equal sovereignty of the states. Notably, the Court did not strike down Section 5, but without Section 4, few jurisdictions will be subject to Section 5 preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula. Those that are still subject to preclearance fall under it because of the Section 3 “bail-in” provision.

Efforts to enfranchise even the most unpopular and least powerful group of all citizens—those who had been convicted of crimes—began to gain momentum. Felons had long be denied the right to vote, and that penalty was even given something of a constitutional sanction by the 14th Amendment, which allowed states to deny the right to vote to criminals without sanction.   In 1974, most states continued to disenfranchise felons and those convicted of certain specified crimes. In roughly half the states, disenfranchisement was permanent, but in several, an appeal to the governor or other state official could be made to have voting rights restored. In other states, criminals were disenfranchised for a fixed period of time or simply while incarcerated or through the period of parole.   The exact list of crimes that triggered disenfranchisement varied considerably from state to state. Major felonies and violent crimes triggered exclusion almost everywhere, but sometimes lesser offenses like vagrancy and theft were also enumerated. In many states, the list of crimes were holdovers from the laws designed to exclude African Americans and immigrant populations.

By the late 1990s, only ten states still disenfranchised felons for life, but every state except Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont continued to disenfranchise felons while they were still incarcerated. Many states continued their ban through probation and parole.   Felon disfranchisement continues to be a hot-button political issue: approximately 4 million Americans were excluded from voting at the beginning of the 21st century, most of them minorities. 14% of African American men were barred from polls nationwide in 2000.

These laws are distinct from laws that require pre-registration to vote.   As of 2015, 33 states have voter ID laws in place. They vary widely in their requirements, from stricter laws requiring state-issued photo IDs in some states, to basic laws that allow identification by a variety of means.   In a trend that has prompted some controversy among voting rights advocates, more states than ever are requiring photo ID. Twelve states now require voters to show some form of photo identification and efforts are being made in as many other states to institute similar requirements.

Holder, which struck down the Section 4 coverage provisions. This cleared the way, in many respects, for states and localities with poor track records of protecting voting rights to enact voter ID laws which may have a negative effect on some populations—without federal approval.
