Two women, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, combined forces to issue a public call for a “convention” to “discuss the social, civil, and religious rights of women.” Lucretia Mott was a prominent Quaker abolitionist from Philadelphia, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton was the daughter of a judge from upstate New York. Together, they combined forces to organize a convention in a Seneca Falls church attended by more than 300 people, including many men.  The proceedings included Mott as a forceful keynote speaker advocating for the political rights of women.

Stanton modeled her resolution after the Declaration of Independence, declaring that “all men and women are created equal,” and “The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman.” Then, just as the Declaration of Independence had done, Stanton included a list of grievances on the part of women, which included, among many others: “He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise,” and “Having deprived her of this first right of a citizen, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representations in the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.” Taken as a whole, the Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments argued that the legal and political order created by men had relegated women to an inferior place in all aspects of the law.  Seneca Falls is remembered as the flashpoint that ignited the women’s suffrage movement—but its centrality is likely exaggerated due to the role that Stanton went on to play as leader and chronicler of the movement. In reality, numerous similar meetings and conventions, with similar outcomes, were taking place across the North—declaring the sentiments that would become the basis for women’s rights.

Unlike African American slaves, who were regarded as inferior beings, women were seen as intelligent adults, but with capacities different from those of men. These capacities were better suited to private life—often called the “domestic sphere”—where women could serve as mothers raising virtuous children and as supporting wives.  It was primarily under this rationale that women were kept from the polls—their first duty was to family, and accordingly they lacked the independence necessary to vote. This logic was along much the same lines as the thinking that kept the poor and the propertyless from the polls. Economically and legally subservient to men, women could not be independent political actors.  Additionally, in a twisted expression of the old colonial idea of “virtual representation,” it was argued in some circles that women did not need the right to vote because their interests could be expressed and defended by the votes of the male members of the families.

Abigail Adams’ now famous exhortation to her husband John to “remember the ladies” was symbolic of the push to incorporate women to a greater degree in the political process—that their interests and needs mattered and could not be adequately protected by men alone.  There were some small but significant strides made early on for the rights of women. Women could vote in New Jersey from 1797 to 1807, proving that enfranchising women was neither unthinkable nor disastrous for society. Furthermore, many of the opponents of women’s right to vote in that state argued not along gendered lines, but along political ones: William Griffith, calling for the vote to be taken away from women, felt that the  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1548","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1548","title":"“mischief” caused by women voting was that it gave “the towns and populous villages . . . an unfair advantage over the country.”  In the 1840s and 1850s, the push for women’s rights gained momentum. The Seneca Falls convention and others like it accessed the democratic trends and inclinations of Jacksonian America. A growing urban population supported women’s rights, embracing a universal expansion of civil, economic, and political rights. The number of women employed in industrial jobs like textiles meant that the profile of women outside of a family context was growing; more women were financially independent and directly affected by labor, monetary, and legal policies. Women were also becoming more politically active in what ways they could—many supported abolitionist societies, which proved to be a training ground for future organizing around the issue of women’s rights.These shifts in the social structure gave rise to many efforts to rethink and promote the rights of women.

In the North there was strong support for the idea that along with freedom should come political rights for African Americans. Sensitivity for the condition of former slaves invigorated rhetoric of universal rights, and the Republican party—in control of Congress and most state legislatures—was in a position to turn advocacy into reality. Those in the women’s suffrage movement anticipated that the progress made towards universal rights in the name of African Americans would advance the cause of women’s rights as well, sweeping women into the franchise alongside freedmen. Elizabeth Cady Stanton remarked that women intended “to avail ourselves of the strong arm and the blue uniform of the black soldier to walk in by his side.”  Women also argued that they had taken steps toward earning the right to vote as a result of supporting the war effort. This was, of course, true in both the North and the South, and was aimed at neutralizing the argument that women should not vote because they did not bear arms.  But the idea that women’s suffrage could be linked to African American political rights would not come to frutition.

In its attempts to protect the voting rights of African Americans, it instituted a penalty of sorts—a reduction in congressional representation and votes in the electoral college, according to the percentage of the population disenfranchised by each state. But the language adopted was crucial—the reduction in representation would be according to the number of voting-age males kept outside of the franchise.  The language was significant. It signaled that voting remained the exclusive province of men. Stanton, in a prescient warning, declared “if the word ‘male’ be inserted, it will take us a century at least to get it out.”  The 15th Amendment, passed in 1869 and ratified in 1870, served only to deepen the divide between women’s suffrage and African American voting rights. Not only did the 15th Amendment prohibit discrimination against African American men, in a way condoning discrimination based on sex, but Congress had passed on the opportunity to put forward other, far broader guarantees of the rights to vote during the drafting process.

The state-by-state stragegy of the AWSA was not very successful either. Although women’s voting rights were debated in numerous constitutional conventions, and referenda were held in 11 states—eight of them west of Mississippi—between 1870 and 1910, only a few states took any real steps to enfranchise women. The territory of Wyoming enfranchised women in 1869 and kept women enfranchised when it became a state in 1889. The territory of Utah enfranchisd women in 1870 and kept women enfranchised when it became a state in 1896. The nearby states of Idaho and Colorado enfranchised women in the mid-1890s. Everywhere else repeated attempts at state constitutional amendments and numerous referenda failed, usually by wide margins. By 1900, despite the decades of work on the part of suffragists, only four states had granted women the right to vote.

Partial suffrage had a certain logic to it—permitting women to vote for things like local school boards or on liquor laws lent them a voice on the issues that were supposedly most appropriate or of interest to women.   The limited success of the women’s suffrage movement following Reconstruction undersold the strength of the movement as a whole. Its growth during this time was remarkable—it could now claim two national organiziations and hundreds more state and local organiziations under the banner of women’s suffrage. And while they were still in the minority, hundreds of thousands of men had voted in favor of enfranchising women in the numerous referenda and state constitutional conventions that had taken up the issue. That the issue was being discussed at all was an accomplishment; such debates would not have been possible 30 to 40 years earlier.

Importantly, the movement started to move beyond its brief turn towards conservatism, becoming socially and ideologically more diverse, and attracting both elite and working-class supporters to complement its middle-class base.  The engagement of working-class women brought with it stronger support for women’s suffrage from trade unions and social organizations. The American Federation of Labor had endorsed women’s suffrage as early as 1892, but once suffrage organizations themselves begin to appeal to working-class interests, the organization lent its lobbying and organizational power to the cause—a major boon for the movement.  Thanks in part to bringing working-class interests into the fold, the campaign for women’s suffrage had become a mass movement by 1910. With support far broader than it had ever enjoyed before, the movement also began to win new victories. Several new states permitted women to vote:   Washington (1910), California (1911), Arizona (1912), Kansas (1912), Oregon (1912), Montana (1914), and Nevada (1914) ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_1200","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1200","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_1201","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1201","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1596","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1596","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1597","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1597","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide91358","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"A Mass Movement","thumbnail":"dr/Slide91358_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si91392","si91394","Text_Caption_1595","Image_1596","Image_1597"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide91358"}}},{"id":"si91472","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si91474","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_458","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_458","title":"The Women’s Suffrage Movement ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_321","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_321","title":"A Mass Movement ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1596","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1596","title":"Increasing Momentum ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1597","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1597","title":"In 1912, Congress authorized the territory of Alaska to enfranchise women if its legislature so chose, and in 1913, Illinois voted to allow women to vote in presidential elections and in elections for all state and local offices not provided for in its constitution.

Though his endorsement was weak and in many ways deprecating to women, he was the first president to come out publicly in favor of the right to vote for women—a major victory for the cause.  Leaders of the movement used their growing profile to put pressure on the federal government, and in 1910 delivered a petition to Congress signed by more than 400,000 women that called for a federal amendment.

Anti-suffrage forces were strong and well organized. Race played a major role; any expansion of the franchise in the South threatened to disrupt the delicate web of voting laws that had been constructed to keep African Americans from the polls.  Calls for a federal amendment also undercut the women’s suffrage in the South.

The old debate about which strategy—state-by-state or a national strategy—would be most effective resurfaced in 1915. Many in the NAWSA wanted to continue focusing on states. After all, that strategy had yielded victories. It could gain more traction in the South, they argued, because it did not activate fears of federal incursions into state authority, and they pointed out that Congress had voted against a federal amendment in early 1915.  But state campaigns required massive financial investments and the mobilization of women across the country. Contests in the South and the Midwest seemed almost unwinnable, and amending many state constitutions required elaborate, multi-layered, repetitive voting by successive sessions of the state legislature or popular referenda.

It required only a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress, followed by the ratification of three quarters of the state legislatures. A federal amendment was also supported by those who felt the only acceptable outcome was for all women, everywhere, to have the right to vote. Accordingly, two leaders in the NAWSA, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, created the Congressional Union in 1913, which would focus its attention on securing a federal amendment. By 1915, the NAWSA had also shifted towards pursuing a federal amendment more aggressively.  The text of the proposed 19th Amendment, still modeled on the 15th was simple and straightforward:  Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex.  Section 2. Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce the provisions of this article.  Carrie Chapman Catt, who had been reelected president of NAWSA in 1915, started to refocus the local apparatuses that her organization had built to support reform at a state level, leveraging them to build support for ratification in the 36 states most likely to ratify an amendment. She also helped to grow the organization’s membership significantly, taking it from 100,000 to 2 million by 1917.

The most important opportunity that WWI gave to suffragists, however, was the opportunity to enthusiastically support the war effort and contribute to the mobilization. This, of course, helped to address the question of the age-old link between voting and military service. By supporting the war effort, women could show their patriotism even if they could not serve on the field of battle itself.  The NAWSA converted its local chapters into volunteer groups that organized in support of the war—teaching classes, collecting and distributing food, knitting clothes for soldiers, and working closely with the Red Cross. Local women’s suffrage organizations sold war bonds and thrift stamps: in New York, the women’s suffrage party sold over $1 million in war bonds—this demonstration of the commitment to the mobilization doubtless contributed to the success of the referendum in that key state. And as a political reality, the NAWSA was a supporter of the Wilson administration, which was especially crucial during wartime.

The measure passed by a single vote, supported by most House Republicans and about half of the House Democrats. Quite significantly, most of the congressmen who changed their votes came from states that had adopted some form of women’s suffrage in the interim.  Support was not so forthcoming in the Senate, which took an additional year and a half to endorse the amendment. Anti-suffrage southern Democrats made up a large portion of the Senate, making the necessary two-thirds majority harder to reach. Wilson kept up the pressure, addressing the Senate again in 1918 and emphasizing the link between women’s suffrage and the war effort, declaring it was “essential to the successful prosecution of the great war of humanity in which we are engaged . . . we have made partners of the women in this world. Shall we admit them only to a partnership of sacrifice and suffering and toll and not to be a partnership of privilege and of right? This war could not have been fought . . . if it had not been for the services of women.” Wilson was clearly convinced that the support women had lent to the war effort had more than qualified them for the franchise.

The cause of women’s suffrage had expanded from an agenda of middle-class, educated women, to a mass movement with support from many segments of the population. The support women had lent to the war mobilization recommended them highly for enfranchisement, and once again, party politics had put some expansive pressure on the franchise.

But the local apparatus of the NAWSA was well prepared for the task of navigating the 19th Amendment through state legislatures and securing its ratification. States in much of the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West (where women could already vote) were quick in offering their agreement to the proposed amendment. The major legislative battles occurred in Texas, Oklahoma, and Connecticut, but the movement was strong enough to secure victory in two of the three—Connecticut voted no.

Leaders of the movement attempted to reassure southern legislatures that enfranchising women did not pose a threat to white superiority, even arguing that if white women could vote, they would help reinforce the social order. But the South remained opposed, and cries of state’s rights masked deep anxiety about race. In New Orleans, Kate Gordon, who was an activist in favor of women’s suffrage, but only by state action, worked to block ratification in New Orleans and the neighboring state of Mississippi. The 19th Amendment was ratified only by the four border states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas.  On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify, again by a margin of one vote. A week later, the ratification had been formally certified, and the 19th Amendment was law.

Although many of the most vocal opponents to enfranchising women had feared it would cause a revolution in American politics—no such revolution occurred. Women did not vote in huge numbers after being enfranchised; in fact, they voted at rates lower than men. Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge were the first presidents elected with women in the electorate, and conservative Republicans stayed in control through the 1920s. Despite persistent fears that enfranchising women would destroy families and taint women, no such disintegration of traditional values occurred.

Indeed, by the time the 19th Amendment was ratified, women had been voting for years in many state and local elections without revolutionary consequences.   But it would be a mistake to assess the impact of women’s suffrage at only this level. Even though the enfranchisement of women did not have an immediate or disruptive impact on national politics, granting women the right to vote across the country had many subtle, long-range consequences.    Women helped to inject new issues into the political arena—issues of social justice, welfare, and issues affecting children received national attention because of the voter base that women now represented. Concrete reforms may have been slow to materialize, but by the 1930s, many of these issues were front and center.

The long road to success for the women’s suffrage movement could culimate only when images and norms of gender roles had begun to shift—that women could support the war effort, and that local experiences and evolving beliefs could warm the idea of a woman’s right to vote enough to bring women into the polity.
