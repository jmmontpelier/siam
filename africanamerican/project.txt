Women had been enfranchised, resolving one of the largest points of conflict about American suffrage, and in the South, the web of complex restrictions was reliably holding African Americans and many poor whites out of the franchise.  The last state to impose a literacy test for voting was Oregon in 1924, bringing the total number of states who used that tool to control the franchise to 18. No state repealed its literacy test following World War I, and most kept them in force through the 1960s. Along with literacy tests, most of the other schemes that southern states had concocted to keep African Americans disenfranchised remained in force, while the federal government continued not to interfere with their enforcement. It was the stance of Congress and the Supreme Court that laws that did not overtly violate the 15th Amendment were constitutional.  In the North, most of the restrictions on the franchise put in place at the turn of the century also remained in force. Immigrants had to overcome lengthy residency requirements, naturalization fees, and in many cases literacy tests if they wanted to vote. The laws that aimed at keeping old-line Repubilcans in power were effective, and little changed about northern politics during this time.

Residency requirements became universal—they were typically one year but could be shorter or longer depending on the state. It was also common for localities to adopt residency requirements for their own elections, usually shorter than those required by states.  Most states also adopted voter registration laws by 1940; only Arkansas did not have a voter registration law, because its constitution prohibited one. While most voter registration laws had their genesis in cities, the convenience offered by preregistration led to their adoption everywhere.  The stability in voting laws from 1920 through World War II reflected a calming of elite and middle-class apprehensions about the breadth of the franchise along several different lines—efforts of disenfranchising African Americans in the South were working, and enfranchisement of women created no serious disruptions to the political order.  Accordingly, for a few years at least, there were significant pressures neither to enlarge the franchise, nor to constrict it further.

The largest military engagement in American history mobilized almost every male of military age—including approximately 1,000,000 African Americans, and thousands of Native Americans and Asian Americans. As it had been many times before, the deployment of disenfranchised soldiers brought up the inescapable question—could they be asked to lay down their lives for a country where they did not enjoy the right to vote?  The war aims of the United States during World War II also shaped how it would impact the development of American democracy. It was clear the United States was fighting a war for democracy—to restore democratic regimes to the conquered nations of Europe, as well as to end the racial and ethnic discrimination practiced by the Nazis and the Japanese. This ideological element of World War II is abundantly clear in the wartime propaganda and the wartime messages coming form the Roosevelt White House. At the same time, however, both the Nazis and the Japanese used it to their advantage that the United States was still hugely discriminatory toward large parts of its population.  The United States’ hypocrisy undercut its message of democratic values. World War II was as much an ideological war as it was a military war. And to achieve victory in the ideological war, for America to be the beacon of democracy it claimed to be, addressing inequality at home became a newly pressing concern of the federal government.

Declaring “we shall not abate one iota our struggle for full citizenship rights in the United States,” the NAACP combated lynching, social segregation, and disenfranchisement with a growing social movement and an increasingly sophisticated legal apparatus that in a few years began to win key victories in the battle for civil rights.

Most states already allowed absentee voting, but the Soldier Voting Act standardized and federalized those procedures.  On its face, the act was just an administrative provision, but it contained a provision that was something more: the act exempting any soldier from having to pay a poll tax.

For several decades, Democratic primaries across the South had been open to whites only—and because the Democratic Party was the only viable party in the South, keeping blacks from the primaries meant they could not vote in the only election that mattered. Since it could be argued that the Democratic Party was a private organization, such restrictions did not seem to violate the 15th Amendment, and made for an efficient way to ensure black disenfranchisement.  The Supreme Court had upheld the practice of white primaries in the landmark case Grovey v. Townsend in 1935, ruling that private rather than state actions were not subject to constitutional prohibitions. But in 1944, the Supreme Court reversed Grovey v. Townsend in its decision in Smith v. Allwright. The Court ruled that excluding African Americans from Democratic primaries was unconstitutional. The opinion relied on a case from three years earlier, U.S. v. Classic et al., that had extended the Constitution’s implicit guarantee of a right to vote in Article I, Sections 2 and 4, to primaries as well as general elections.

Additionally, the New Deal had ushered in an era when both Congress and the Court were far more willing to assert the power of the federal government than ever before—not just in voting, but in almost every domain imaginable.   Smith v. Allwright dramatically changed the landscape of the franchise and voting law in the South: it was the first crack in the thick armor that white Southern politicians has constructed to keep blacks from the polls.

The white primary—the simplest and most effective way that white southerners had devised to keep African Americans out of political life—had been swept away, never to return. Southern politicians were enraged by the decision, calling it a gross overreach of federal authority. Many states tried their hardest to circumvent Smith v.

Truman responded with compromise—he issued two executive orders that desegregated the military and instituted equal employment opportunity practices within the federal government. But Truman declined to support the full range of reforms proposed by his Committee on Civil Rights.  Truman’s reluctance to become a vocal advocate for civil rights and African American suffrage meant that the movement lacked a strong leader in the federal government, and for a decade following the report of the Committee on Civil Rights, the federal government did very little to curb racial discrimination of every kind.

The Supreme Court not only upheld this legislation, but also actively struck down vestiges of discriminatory voting law. Together, Congress and the Court removed almost a century of barriers to voting, to the point that there remained almost no formal restrictions on the voting rights of adult citizens in the United States.

Dozens of national and regional organizations sprung up, each pursuing their own strategies—some non-violent, some militant—to win civil rights from African Americans. The NAACP, local trade unions, the newly formed Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and countless others organized African American citizens to march, rally, protest, boycott, sit-in, write petitions, and sue, challenging the system of Jim Crow. Slowly but surely, the momentum behind the civil rights movement placed overwhelming pressure on America’s system of racial discrimination, and real change stated to occur.   In 1954, the Supreme Court handed down one of its most important decisions to date: Brown v. Board of Education. Overturning the infamous precedent of “separate but equal” established in Plessy v. Ferguson, the decision in Brown signaled that the Court was willing to advance the cause of civil rights. The decision had come as the result of a well developed and highly organized strategy of litigation on the part of the NAACP—one that would continue to bear fruit over the next several decades.

Many states developed a policy known as “massive resistance” in opposition to desegregation, shutting down school systems entirely so that they could not be integrated. Sheriffs arrested and beat black protesters and their white allies, and teachers treated black students with outright scorn.   As fierce as the opposition to desegregation was, Brown v. Board of Education was a major victory for the Civil Rights Movement, and the violence in the South only served to focus more national attention on the issue. African Americans kept up the pressure surrounding the issue of voting rights, understanding that the franchise was key to securing other civil rights. “Once Negroes start voting in large numbers,” reported one black newspaper, “the Jim Crow laws will be endangered.” “Give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with men of good will,” declared the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. to a crowd of nearly 30,000 people in front of the Lincoln Memorial in 1957.

But more importantly, it called for a constitutional amendment that “would give the right to vote every citizen who meets a state’s age and residency requirement, and who is not legally confined at the time of registration or election.” Interestingly enough, the language proposed by the Commission bore a strong resemblance to the broad version of the 15th Amendment proposed by Henry Wilson in the 1860s.  Meanwhile, the violence and conflict was intensifying in the South. The now-famous sit-in at a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960 set off yet another wave of protests and demonstrations against Jim Crow, and activists boycotted bus systems in Birmingham and other major cities across the South.

Put forth as an emergency measure, the Voting Rights of 1965 did the following:   Immediately suspended literary tests and other “devices” (good character and vouching requirements) for five years in states and counties where fewer than 50% of all adults had registered to vote 1964.

Racism is deeply engrained in American history and culture, and resistance to federal involvement in the affairs of states has animated political conflict almost from the inception.

The experience of implementing the Voting Rights Act, as well as evidence of continued voting rights violations gathered by the Civil Rights division of the Justice Department, led Congress to renew the Voting Rights Act four times: in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 2006. Sustained federal involvement was necessary to continue to protect the voting rights of African Americans—and many districts in the South remained “covered” under the preclearance provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act for decades.

But the Warren Court reversed course in the 1960s defending the guarantees of the 15th Amendment, and even finding 14th Amendment equal protection grounds for striking down discriminatory legislation.   Six states—Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia—challenged the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act, claiming its core provisions “exceed the powers of Congress and encroach on an area reserved to the states by the Constitution.” The Court upheld the law—and the federal takeover of state voting laws it represented—in the 1966 case South Carolina v. Katzenbach. The decision found the provisions of the Voting Rights Act to be “a valid means for carrying out the commands the 15th Amendment.” Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing the opinion for the Court, called attention to “the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which has infected the electoral process… for nearly a century” in the United States, as well as the failure of less drastic measures to “cure the problem of voting discrimination.” The 8-1 decision validated the “array of potent weapons” for enforcing the 15th Amendment included in the Voting Rights Act, and expressed the hope that “millions of non-white Americans will now be able to participate for the first time on an equal basis in the government under which they live.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1697","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1697","title":"Nicholas Katzenbach at the White House ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1556","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1556","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1698","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1698","title":"The Warren Court ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1557","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1557","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_1181","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1181","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_1182","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1182","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1642","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1642","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1643","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1643","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_1124","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1124","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_1125","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1125","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide90807","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Role of the Supreme Court","thumbnail":"dr/Slide90807_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si90841","si90843","Text_Caption_1597","Text_Caption_1697","Image_1556","Text_Caption_1698","Image_1557","Image_1642","Image_1643"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide90807"}}},{"id":"si91189","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si91191","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_462","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_462","title":"African American Suffrage ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_327","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_327","title":"The Role of the Supreme Court ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1600","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1600","title":"Shaping the Franchise ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1433","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1433","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1611","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1611","title":"The Voting Rights Act and the decision in South Carolina v.

It was a carryover from colonial precendents, and for most of American history, states had been remarkably consistent in maintaining 21 as the voting age. But for almost as long as laws setting a voting age had been in place, there had been a sporadic campaign to see it lowered.  Efforts to lower the voting age, like many other voting rights issues, often corresponded with military conflicts.

Vietnam changed everything. The unpopular war inspired political activism on the part of 18, 19, and 20 year-olds of the kind the nation had never seen. Draft protests and college demonstrations pushed younger people into the political sphere, and their disfranchisement underscored the lack of democratic support for the war and legitimized resistance to the draft.

The verdict and the reasoning behind it were complex and varied, but the result of the decision was a bifurcated voting age: 18 in federal elections and 21 in state and local elections in almost every state.

The Senate voted 94-0 in favor, and the House voted 401-19.  State legislatures rushed to ratify the 26th Amendment. By the end of June, 38 states had ratified. Less than six months after Oregon v.

Moving the country toward universal suffrage was not accomplished by a single action—no one law or constitutional amendment guaranteed the right to vote for all Americans.

After all, these were the things that structured and gave meaning to votes once they could be cast.

Though the decision was a narrow, technical one, its implications were far-reaching, laying the groundwork for the now-famous maxim “one person, one vote.”  One year after Baker v. Carr, the Court struck down Georgia’s longstanding “county unit” primary system on the grounds that it weighed “rural votes more heavily than urban votes and weighed some small rural counties ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1636","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1636","title":"heavier than other large rural counties.” The ruling in this case, Gary v.

The Court continued to rely on this reasoning the next year in Reynolds v. Simms, striking down Alabama’s districting system, which gave 25% of the state’s population a majority of the seats in the state legislature. Grounding the decision in the Equal Protection Clause once again, Chief Justice Warren, wrote in the majority opinion, “legislators represent people, not trees or acres” and that the “right to vote” of those living in underrepresented areas “is simply not the same right to vote as that of those living in a favorite part of the state.”  By 1965, then, the Constitution had been interpreted to guarantee not only the right of citizens to register and vote on an equal basis with other citizens, but that their vote should carry an equal weight as the other votes case in the same election.

Historically, the republican structure of the United States has been grounded upon the idea that the interests of both individuals and communities could be represented in geographically defined representative districts. The idea was that though the choice of particular representatives belonged to individual voters, the communities they represented had some collective interest and voice in governance. This is why counties were represented directly in most state legislatures and each state in the Union was granted two senators.  But over the course of the late 20th century, the American population became far more mobile than it had ever been. People’s primary community identification shifted away from geographic factors, and membership in less tangible types of communities—religious, racial, ethnic, or occupational—became more slient in defining community interests.  But there were strong historical forces that favored an individualistic conception of the right to vote, so communities would need to find ways to ensure their interests were represented in existing geographically defined districts. The Voting Rights Acts would give them some assistance, requiring the creation of “majority minority” districts, in which the majority of the eligible voters are racial or ethnic minorities. This added layer of insurance that minorities would be able to elect candidates of their choosing was a way of protecting both the individual voting rights of citizens who had historically be disenfranchised, as well as the political interests of their communities, which until then had not received representation.
